Basic KTOR build REST API server to send request to ONE SIGNAL and communicate with Android client app

**Notification**

I love KTOR! This is basic backend server built by KTOR framework. It has only one route that gets data from android app client and posts data to one signal, then one signal sends push notification to users devices. I created this project to get started with KTOR framework and I also connected it to Android app <a href="https://github.com/raheemadamboev/push-notification-ktor-one-signal">Push Notification KTOR One Signal.<a/>
